Existing resources often suffer from semantic drift and context loss, which can lead to misleading performance metrics. In this work, we present a fully automated framework designed to address these challenges by enabling scalable, high-quality translation of datasets and benchmarks. We demonstrate that adapting test-time compute scaling strategies, specifically Universal Self-Improvement (USI) and our proposed multi-round ranking method, T-RANK, allows for significantly higher quality outputs compared to traditional pipelines. Our framework ensures that benchmarks preserve their original task structure and linguistic nuances during localization. We apply this approach to translate popular benchmarks and datasets into eight Eastern and Southern European languages (Ukrainian, Bulgarian, Slovak, Romanian, Lithuanian, Estonian, Turkish, Greek). Evaluations using both reference-based metrics and LLM-as-a-judge show that our translations surpass existing resources, resulting in more accurate downstream model assessment.

For example, recalling that Canberra is Australia's capital may benefit from thinking through major cities and the concept of purpose-built capitals. While reasoning language models are trained via reinforcement learning to produce reasoning traces on tasks such as mathematics, they may not reason well for accessing their own world knowledge. We first find that models do not generate their best world knowledge reasoning by default: adding a simple \"think step-by-step\" cue demonstrates statistically significant improvement in knowledge recall but not math. Motivated by this, we propose training models to reason over their parametric knowledge using world-knowledge question answering as a verifiable reward. After reinforcement learning on TriviaQA (+9.9%), performance also improves on Natural Questions, HotpotQA, SimpleQA, and StrategyQA by 4.2%, 2.1%, 0.6%, and 3.0%, respectively.

This gap stems from two limitations: a shortage of high-quality, action-aligned reasoning data, and the direct adoption of generic post-training pipelines that overlook the unique challenges of GUI agents. We identify two fundamental issues in these pipelines: (i) standard SFT with CoT reasoning often hurts grounding, and (ii) step-wise RLVR-tyle training faces partial verifiability, where multiple actions can be correct but only a single demonstrated action is used for verification. This makes offline step-wise metrics weak predictors of online task success. In this work, we present GUI-Libra, a tailored training recipe that addresses these challenges. First, to mitigate the scarcity of action-aligned reasoning data, we introduce a data construction and filtering pipeline and release a curated 81K GUI reasoning dataset. Second, to reconcile reasoning with grounding, we propose action-aware SFT that mixes reasoning-then-action and direct-action data and reweights tokens to emphasize action and grounding. Third, to stabilize RL under partial verifiability, we identify the overlooked importance of KL regularization in RLVR and show that a KL trust region is critical for improving offline-to-online predictability; we further introduce success-adaptive scaling to downweight unreliable negative gradients. Across diverse web and mobile benchmarks, GUI-Libra consistently improves both step-wise accuracy and end-to-end task completion. Our results suggest that carefully designed post-training and data curation can unlock significantly stronger task-solving capabilities without costly online data collection.

In this paper, we present LiCQA, an unsupervised question answer- ing model that works primarily on the basis of corpus evidence.

Although recent models support increasingly long context windows, their accuracy often deteriorates as input length grows. In practice, models often struggle to keep attention aligned with the most relevant context throughout decoding. In this work, we propose DySCO, a novel decoding algorithm for improving long-context reasoning. DySCO leverages retrieval heads--a subset of attention heads specialized for long-context retrieval--to identify task-relevant tokens at each decoding step and explicitly up-weight them. By doing so, DySCO dynamically adjusts attention during generation to better utilize relevant context. The method is training-free and can be applied directly to any off-the-shelf LMs. Across multiple instruction-tuned and reasoning models, DySCO consistently improves performance on challenging long-context reasoning benchmarks, yielding relative gains of up to 25% on MRCR and LongBenchV2 at 128K context length with modest additional compute. Further analysis highlights the importance of both dynamic attention rescaling and retrieval-head-guided selection for the effectiveness of the method, while providing interpretability insights into decoding-time attention behavior.

To address this, several tools that aim to predict CVD risk and support clinical decision making have been developed. In particular, the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) is one of the most widely used and recommended worldwide. However, it does not explain why a patient was assigned to a particular risk category nor how it can be reduced. Due to this lack of transparency, we present a logical explainer for the FRS. Based on first-order logic and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) fundaments, the explainer is capable of identifying a minimal set of patient attributes that are sufficient to explain a given risk classification. Our explainer also produces actionable scenarios that illustrate which modifiable variables would reduce a patient's risk category. We evaluated all possible input combinations of the FRS (over 22,000 samples) and tested them with our explainer, successfully identifying important risk factors and suggesting focused interventions for each case. The results may improve clinician trust and facilitate a wider implementation of CVD risk assessment by converting opaque scores into transparent and prescriptive insights, particularly in areas with restricted access to specialists.", "authors": "Emannuel L. de A.

Using fully connected networks on standard benchmarks under $k$-fold evaluation, we compare: (i) early stopping with patience and (ii) post-hoc selection over all epochs (i.e. no early stopping). Models are trained with cross-entropy, C-Loss, or PolyLoss; the model parameter selection on the validation set is made using accuracy or one of the three loss functions, each considered independently. Three main findings emerge. (1) Early stopping based on validation accuracy performs worst, consistently selecting checkpoints with lower test accuracy than both loss-based early stopping and post-hoc selection. (2) Loss-based validation criteria yield comparable and more stable test accuracy. (3) Across datasets and folds, any single validation rule often underperforms the test-optimal checkpoint. Overall, the selected model typically achieves test-set performance statistically lower than the best performance across all epochs, regardless of the validation criterion.

Specifically, we evaluate a model's likelihood of knowing the correct answer and the probability that its response is accurate.

We consider the well-studied phenomenon of algorithm aversion, in which human decision-makers exhibit bias against predictions from algorithms. Drawing upon experimental paradigms from behavioural economics, we evaluate how eightdifferent LLMs delegate decision-making tasks when the delegatee is framed as a human expert or an algorithmic agent. To be inclusive of different evaluation formats, we conduct our study with two task presentations: stated preferences, modeled through direct queries about trust towards either agent, and revealed preferences, modeled through providing in-context examples of the performance of both agents. When prompted to rate the trustworthiness of human experts and algorithms across diverse tasks, LLMs give higher ratings to the human expert, which correlates with prior results from human respondents. However, when shown the performance of a human expert and an algorithm and asked to place an incentivized bet between the two, LLMs disproportionately choose the algorithm, even when it performs demonstrably worse. These discrepant results suggest that LLMs may encode inconsistent biases towards humans and algorithms, which need to be carefully considered when they are deployed in high-stakes scenarios.

Conventional physics-based models provide interpretability but struggle with real-world variability, while purely data-driven approaches achieve accuracy at the expense of physical plausibility. This paper introduces a Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (PI-KAN), a hybrid method that integrates interpretable univariate feature transformations with a physics-informed loss function and a leakage-free chained prediction pipeline. Using operational and environmental data from five cargo vessels, PI-KAN consistently outperforms the traditional polynomial method and neural network baselines.

As a cheaper alternative to high-fidelity models, this work develops eight surrogate models for predicting the fluid flow in porous media. Four of these are reduced-order models (ROM) based on one neural network for compression and another for prediction. The other four are single neural networks with the property of grid-size invariance; a term which we use to refer to image-to-image models that are capable of inferring on computational domains that are larger than those used during training. In addition to the novel grid-size-invariant framework for surrogate models, we compare the predictive performance of UNet and UNet++ architectures, and demonstrate that UNet++ outperforms UNet for surrogate models. Furthermore, we show that the grid-size-invariant approach is a reliable way to reduce memory consumption during training, resulting in good correlation between predicted and ground-truth values and outperforming the ROMs analysed.

Existing methods for discovering subgroups with exceptional survival characteristics require restrictive assumptions about the survival model (e.g. proportional hazards), pre-discretized features, and, as they compare average statistics, tend to overlook individual deviations. In this paper, we propose Sysurv, a fully differentiable, non-parametric method that leverages random survival forests to learn individual survival curves, automatically learns conditions and how to combine these into inherently interpretable rules, so as to select subgroups with exceptional survival characteristics.

However, the absence of a comprehensive, accessible dataset pairing transliterations with a digital representation of the tablet's cuneiform glyphs has prevented the application of modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to the task of Sumerian transliteration.   To address this gap, we present SumTablets, a dataset pairing Unicode representations of 91,606 Sumerian cuneiform tablets (totaling 6,970,407 glyphs) with the associated transliterations published by Oracc.

Understanding these limitations is therefore crucial for further advancing the approach.   This work analyzes performance limitations of the classical DeepONet architecture. It is shown that the approximation error is dominated by the branch network when the internal dimension is sufficiently large, and that the learned trunk basis can often be replaced by classical basis functions without a significant impact on performance.   To investigate this further, a modified DeepONet is constructed in which the trunk network is replaced by the left singular vectors of the training solution matrix. This modification yields several key insights. First, a spectral bias in the branch network is observed, with coefficients of dominant, low-frequency modes learned more effectively. Second, due to singular-value scaling of the branch coefficients, the overall branch error is dominated by modes with intermediate singular values rather than the smallest ones. Third, using a shared branch network for all mode coefficients, as in the standard architecture, improves generalization of small modes compared to a stacked architecture in which coefficients are computed separately.

Building on this observation, we introduce Duel-Evolve, an evolutionary optimization algorithm that replaces external scalar rewards with pairwise preferences elicited from the same LLM used to generate candidates. Duel-Evolve aggregates these noisy candidate comparisons via a Bayesian Bradley-Terry model, yielding uncertainty-aware estimates of candidate quality. These quality estimates guide allocation of the comparison budget toward plausible optima using Double Thompson Sampling, as well as selection of high-quality parents to generate improved candidates. We evaluate Duel-Evolve on MathBench, where it achieves 20 percentage points higher accuracy over existing methods and baselines, and on LiveCodeBench, where it improves over comparable iterative methods by over 12 percentage points.

We define a constricting safety tube that is relaxed at the initial noise distribution and progressively tightens to the target safe set at the final data distribution, mirroring the coarse-to-fine structure of the generative process itself. By characterizing this tube via Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), we synthesize a feedback control input through a convex Quadratic Program (QP) at each sampling step.

We identify a root cause that existing methods overlook: the uniform penalization of errors. Current approaches -- whether data-filtering methods that select prompts by difficulty, or advantage normalization schemes -- treat all incorrect rollouts within a group identically. We show that this uniformity allows overconfident errors (incorrect reasoning paths that the RL process has spuriously reinforced) to persist and monopolize probability mass, ultimately suppressing valid exploratory trajectories.

This paper identifies and theorises this phenomenon as the Initial Exploration Problem (IEP). Drawing on theories from information behaviour and human-computer interaction, including ASK, exploratory search, information foraging, and cognitive load theory, we develop a conceptual framing of the IEP characterised by three interdependent barriers: scope uncertainty, ontology opacity, and query incapacity.

To overcome these limitations, we propose a visual cognition-guided collaborative network (VCC-Net) to achieve the cooperative diagnostic paradigm. VCC-Net centers on visual cognition (VC) and employs clinically compatible interfaces, such as eye-tracking or the mouse, to capture radiologists' visual search traces and attention patterns during diagnosis.

Recent work on autoregressive LLMs has identified the Curse of Depth: later layers contribute little to the final output predictions. These findings naturally raise the question of whether a similar depth inefficiency also appears in PLMs, where many widely used models are not autoregressive, and some are multimodal, accepting both protein sequence and structure as input. In this work, we present a depth analysis of six popular PLMs across model families and scales, spanning three training objectives, namely autoregressive, masked, and diffusion, and quantify how layer contributions evolve with depth using a unified set of probing- and perturbation-based measurements. Across all models, we observe consistent depth-dependent patterns that extend prior findings on LLMs: later layers depend less on earlier computations and mainly refine the final output distribution, and these effects are increasingly pronounced in deeper models.

This shift selects for a specific organizational equilibrium -- the Headless Firm -- structured as an hourglass: a personalized generative interface at the top, a standardized protocol waist in the middle, and a competitive market of micro-specialized execution agents at the bottom.

For the Optimal Decision Tree we consider two optimization criteria: worst case identification time (height of the tree) or the average identification time.

Our approach is to develop a number of algorithmic reductions, where an approximation algorithm for one problem provides an approximation for another via a black-box usage of a procedure for the former.

Ski rental was one of the first problems to be studied with predictions, where a natural prediction is simply the number of ski days. But it is both more natural and potentially more powerful to think of a prediction as a distribution p-hat over the ski days. If the true number of ski days is drawn from some true (but unknown) distribution p, then we show as our main result that there is an algorithm with expected cost at most OPT + O(min(max({eta}, 1) * sqrt(b), b log b)), where OPT is the expected cost of the optimal policy for the true distribution p, b is the cost of buying, and {eta} is the Earth Mover's (Wasserstein-1) distance between p and p-hat. Note that when {eta} < o(sqrt(b)) this gives additive loss less than b (the trivial bound), and when {eta} is arbitrarily large (corresponding to an extremely inaccurate prediction) we still do not pay more than O(b log b) additive loss. An implication of these bounds is that our algorithm has consistency O(sqrt(b)) (additive loss when the prediction error is 0) and robustness O(b log b) (additive loss when the prediction error is arbitrarily large). Moreover, we do not need to assume that we know (or have any bound on) the prediction error {eta}, in contrast with previous work in robust optimization which assumes that we know this error.

To address this challenge, we propose FORESEE (Forecasting Online with Residual Smoothing and Ensemble Experts), a lightweight online adaptation framework that is accurate, robust, and computationally efficient. FORESEE operates without any parameter updates to the base model. Instead, it corrects today's forecast in each region using yesterday's prediction error, stabilized through exponential smoothing guided by a mixture-of-experts mechanism that adapts to recent error dynamics. Moreover, an adaptive spatiotemporal smoothing component propagates error signals across neighboring regions and time slots, capturing coherent shifts in demand patterns. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets with three backbone models demonstrate that FORESEE consistently improves prediction accuracy, maintains robustness even when distribution shifts are minimal (avoiding performance degradation), and achieves the lowest computational overhead among existing online methods.

In this paper, we extend fEDM in two major directions. First, we introduce an Explainability and Traceability Module (ETM) that explicitly links each ethical decision rule to the underlying moral principles and computes a weighted principle-contribution profile for every recommended action. This enables transparent, auditable explanations that expose not only what decision was made but why, and on the basis of which principles.

To make these bounds concrete, we upper bound the critical radius using local maximal inequalities and metric-entropy integrals, recovering familiar rates for VC-subgraph, Sobolev/Hölder, and bounded-variation classes.   We also review ERM with nuisance components -- including weighted ERM and Neyman-orthogonal losses -- as they arise in causal inference, missing data, and domain adaptation. Following the orthogonal learning framework, we highlight that these problems often admit regret-transfer bounds linking regret under an estimated loss to population regret under the target loss. These bounds typically decompose regret into (i) statistical error under the estimated (optimized) loss and (ii) approximation error due to nuisance estimation. Under sample splitting or cross-fitting, the first term can be controlled using standard fixed-loss ERM regret bounds, while the second term depends only on nuisance-estimation accuracy.

SELAUR integrates entropy-, least-confidence-, and margin-based metrics into a combined token-level uncertainty estimate, providing dense confidence-aligned supervision, and employs a failure-aware reward reshaping mechanism that injects these uncertainty signals into step- and trajectory-level rewards to improve exploration efficiency and learning stability.

Although existing data-driven approaches have demonstrated effectiveness in the voltage control problem, they often require extensive trial-and-error exploration and struggle to incorporate heterogeneous information, such as day-ahead forecasts and semantic-based grid codes. Considering the operational scenarios and requirements in real-world ADNs, in this paper, we propose a hybrid knowledge-data-driven approach that leverages dynamic collaboration between a large language model (LLM) agent and a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to achieve two-stage voltage control. In the day-ahead stage, the LLM agent receives coarse region-level forecasts and generates scheduling strategies for on-load tap changer (OLTC) and shunt capacitors (SCs) to regulate the overall voltage profile. Then in the intra-day stage, based on accurate node-level measurements, the RL agent refines terminal voltages by deriving reactive power generation strategies for PV inverters. On top of the LLM-RL collaboration framework, we further propose a self-evolution mechanism for the LLM agent and a pretrain-finetune pipeline for the RL agent, effectively enhancing and coordinating the policies for both agents. The proposed approach not only aligns more closely with practical operational characteristics but also effectively utilizes the inherent knowledge and reasoning capabilities of the LLM agent, significantly improving training efficiency and voltage control performance.

The choice of representation and the associated distance determine properties of the methods in which they are used: for example, certain distances can allow one to encode robustness or smoothness of the problem. Kernel methods offer flexible and rich Hilbert space representations of distributions that allow the modeller to enforce properties through the choice of kernel, and estimate associated distances at efficient nonparametric rates. In particular, the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), a kernel-based distance constructed by comparing Hilbert space mean functions, has received significant attention due to its computational tractability and is favoured by practitioners.   In this thesis, we conduct a thorough study of kernel-based distances with a focus on efficient computation, with core contributions in Chapters 3 to 6. Part I of the thesis is focused on the MMD, specifically on improved MMD estimation. In Chapter 3 we propose a theoretically sound, improved estimator for MMD in simulation-based inference. Then, in Chapter 4, we propose an MMD-based estimator for conditional expectations, a ubiquitous task in statistical computation. Closing Part I, in Chapter 5 we study the problem of calibration when MMD is applied to the task of integration.   In Part II, motivated by the recent developments in kernel embeddings beyond the mean, we introduce a family of novel kernel-based discrepancies: kernel quantile discrepancies. These address some of the pitfalls of MMD, and are shown through both theoretical results and an empirical study to offer a competitive alternative to MMD and its fast approximations.

In these scenarios, standard data analysis techniques often fail to capture the nature of the data, as the system's response varies significantly across the state space due to its stochasticity and the different physical regimes. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) should thus not be viewed merely as a safety assessment, but as a support to the learning task itself, guiding the model to internalise the behaviour of the data. We address this by focusing on the Critical Heat Flux (CHF) benchmark and dataset presented by the OECD/NEA Expert Group on Reactor Systems Multi-Physics. This case study represents a test for scientific ML due to the non-linear dependence of CHF on the inputs and the existence of distinct microscopic physical regimes. These regimes exhibit diverse statistical profiles, a complexity that requires UQ techniques to internalise the data behaviour and ensure reliable predictions. In this work, we conduct a comparative analysis of UQ methodologies to determine their impact on physical representation. We contrast post-hoc methods, specifically conformal prediction, against end-to-end coverage-oriented pipelines, including (Bayesian) heteroscedastic regression and quality-driven losses. These approaches treat uncertainty not as a final metric, but as an active component of the optimisation process, modelling the prediction and its behaviour simultaneously.

To address these limitations, we propose Primary-Fine Decoupling for Action Generation (PF-DAG), a two-stage framework that decouples coarse action consistency from fine-grained variations. First, we compress action chunks into a small set of discrete modes, enabling a lightweight policy to select consistent coarse modes and avoid mode bouncing. Second, a mode conditioned MeanFlow policy is learned to generate high-fidelity continuous actions.

To ensure a fair comparison, we adapt each model with specialized temporal processing and a modular layer that cleanly integrates weather covariates. Our results reveal that there is no single best model for all situations. When forecasting using only historical load, PatchTST and the state space models provide the highest accuracy.

We focus on the bounded label noise setting to determine whether the fast $1/ε$ rates achievable in single-task learning extend to this regime with minimal dependence on $k$. Surprisingly, we show that this is not the case. We demonstrate that learning across $k$ distributions inherently incurs slow rates scaling with $k/ε^2$, even under constant noise levels, unless each distribution is learned separately. A key technical contribution is a structured hypothesis-testing framework that captures the statistical cost of certifying near-optimality under bounded noise-a cost we show is unavoidable in the multi-distribution setting.

To mitigate this, recent content-aware semantic watermarking schemes bind watermark signals to high-level image semantics, constraining local edits that would otherwise disrupt global coherence.

Methods: Two black-box adversarial attacks were developed: (1) Structured Speckle Amplification Attack (SSAA), which injects boundary-targeted noise, and (2) Frequency-Domain Ultrasound Attack (FDUA), which applies bandpass-filtered phase perturbations in the Fourier domain. Three inference-time mitigations were evaluated on adversarial images: randomized preprocessing with test-time augmentation, deterministic input denoising, and stochastic ensemble inference with consistency-aware aggregation.

As AI decouples cognition from biology, the marginal cost of measurable execution falls to zero, absorbing any labor capturable by metrics--including creative, analytical, and innovative work. The binding constraint on growth is no longer intelligence but human verification bandwidth: the capacity to validate, audit, and underwrite responsibility when execution is abundant. We model the AGI transition as the collision of two racing cost curves: an exponentially decaying Cost to Automate and a biologically bottlenecked Cost to Verify. This structural asymmetry widens a Measurability Gap between what agents can execute and what humans can afford to verify. It also drives a shift from skill-biased to measurability-biased technical change. Rents migrate to verification-grade ground truth, cryptographic provenance, and liability underwriting--the ability to insure outcomes rather than merely generate them. The current human-in-the-loop equilibrium is unstable: eroded from below as apprenticeship collapses (Missing Junior Loop) and from within as experts codify their obsolescence (Codifier's Curse). Unverified deployment becomes privately rational--a Trojan Horse externality. Unmanaged, these forces pull toward a Hollow Economy. Yet by scaling verification alongside agentic capabilities, the forces that threaten collapse become the catalyst for unbounded discovery and experimentation--an Augmented Economy.

In AlphaZero, prior work Go-Exploit applies this idea by sampling past states from self-play or search trees, but it treats all states equally, regardless of their learning potential. We propose Regret-Guided Search Control (RGSC), which extends AlphaZero with a regret network that learns to identify high-regret states, where the agent's evaluation diverges most from the actual outcome.

We apply CST in two settings: (1) CoT monitoring with cue-based counterfactuals, to detect when models rely on spurious features, reward hack, or are sycophantic, and (2) counterfactual simulation over generic model-based counterfactuals, to encourage models to produce more faithful, generalizable reasoning in the CoT. Experiments with models up to 235B parameters show that CST can substantially improve monitor accuracy on cue-based counterfactuals (by 35 accuracy points) as well as simulatability over generic counterfactuals (by 2 points). We further show that: (1) CST outperforms prompting baselines, (2) rewriting unfaithful CoTs with an LLM is 5x more efficient than RL alone, (3) faithfulness improvements do not generalize to dissuading cues (as opposed to persuading cues), and (4) larger models do not show more faithful CoT out of the box, but they do benefit more from CST.

By deploying a dual-evaluation matrix (7 judges x 5 solvers) against 1,000+ hours of human evaluation, we reveal that certain frontier evaluators like Claude Opus 4.5, DeepSeek-V3, Qwen 2.5 Max, and Llama 4 Maverick exhibit significant positive bias (up to +0.18, +0.20, +0.30, +0.36 mean score inflation, respectively). Furthermore, we uncover a critical reasoning gap in the discrete domain: while Gemini 3.0 Pro achieves state-of-the-art performance (0.91 average human evaluation score), other reasoning models like GPT-5 Pro and Claude Sonnet 4.5 see their performance significantly degrade in discrete domains. Specifically, their average human evaluation scores drop to 0.72 and 0.63 in Discrete Math, and to 0.74 and 0.50 in Graph Theory. In addition to these research results, we also release QEDBench as a public benchmark for evaluating and improving AI judges.

First, at the individual level, LLMs exhibit fixation just as humans do, where early outputs constrain subsequent ideation. Second, at the collective level, LLMs aggregate knowledge into a unified distribution rather than exhibiting the knowledge partitioning inherent to human populations, where each person occupies a distinct region of the knowledge space. Through four studies, we demonstrate that targeted prompting interventions can address each mechanism independently: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting reduces fixation by encouraging structured reasoning (only in LLMs, not humans), while ordinary personas (versus \"creative entrepreneurs\" such as Steve Jobs) improve knowledge partitioning by serving as diverse sampling cues, anchoring generation in distinct regions of the semantic space.

To bridge this critical gap, we propose a new causal reasoning benchmark, CausalFlip, designed to encourage the development of new LLM paradigm or training algorithms that ground LLM reasoning in causality rather than semantic correlation. CausalFlip consists of causal judgment questions built over event triples that could form different confounder, chain, and collider relations.

Overall, we show that equally-sized ReLU MLPs and equivariant architectures are equally expressive over equivariant functions.

The default assumption is that English is the best-performing language for LLMs, while smaller, low-resource languages are linked to less reliable outputs, even in multilingual, state-of-the-art models.

A malicious prompt injected into a conversation can compromise later reasoning, trigger dangerous tool calls, or distort final outputs. Despite the centrality of such systems, we currently lack a principled semantic foundation for reasoning about their behaviour and safety. We address this gap by introducing an untyped call-by-value lambda calculus enriched with dynamic information-flow control and a small number of primitives for constructing prompt-response conversations. Our language includes a primitive that invokes an LLM: it serializes a value, sends it to the model as a prompt, and parses the response as a new term. This calculus faithfully represents planner loops and their vulnerabilities, including the mechanisms by which prompt injection alters subsequent computation. The semantics explicitly captures conversations, and so supports reasoning about defenses such as quarantined sub-conversations, isolation of generated code, and information-flow restrictions on what may influence an LLM call.

By deriving the optimal parameter update magnitude that minimizes forgetting, we unify two representative update paradigms, frozen training and initialized training, within an optimization framework for constrained parameter updates. Our theoretical results further reveals that sequence tasks with small parameter distances exhibit better generalization and less forgetting under frozen training rather than initialized training.

Conversely, an aligned AI fosters trust yet risks reinforcing suboptimal human behavior and lowering human-AI team performance. In this paper, we start by identifying this fundamental tension between performance-boosting (i.e., complementarity) and trust-building (i.e., alignment) as an inherent limitation of the traditional approach for training a single AI model to assist human decision making. To overcome this, we introduce a novel human-centered adaptive AI ensemble that strategically toggles between two specialist AI models - the aligned model and the complementary model - based on contextual cues, using an elegantly simple yet provably near-optimal Rational Routing Shortcut mechanism. Comprehensive theoretical analyses elucidate why the adaptive AI ensemble is effective and when it yields maximum benefits.

We extend TAM by incorporating trust, perceived enjoyment, and subjective norms as additional factors that capture social and affective influences and uncertainty around AI outputs.   Using partial least squares structural equation modeling, we find perceived usefulness remains the strongest predictor of students' intention to use conversational AI. However, perceived ease of use does not exert a significant direct effect on behavioral intention once other factors are considered, operating instead indirectly through perceived usefulness. Trust and subjective norms significantly influence perceptions of usefulness, while perceived enjoyment exerts both a direct and indirect effect on usage intentions.

Specifically, starting from a PINN trained on the full dataset, P-PINN evaluates a joint residual--data fidelity indicator, a weighted combination of data misfit and PDE residuals, to partition the training set into reliable and corrupted subsets. Next, we introduce a bias-based neuron importance measure that quantifies directional activation discrepancies between the two subsets, identifying neurons whose representations are predominantly driven by corrupted samples. Building on this, an iterative pruning strategy then removes noise-sensitive neurons layer by layer. The resulting pruned network is fine-tuned on the reliable data subject to the original PDE constraints, acting as a lightweight post-processing stage rather than a complete retraining.

Despite Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in promoting BIM-based design, the lack of specific datasets and LLM evaluation benchmarks has significantly hindered the performance of LLMs. Therefore, this paper addresses this gap by proposing: 1) an evaluation benchmark for BIM-based design together with corresponding quantitative indicators to evaluate the performance of LLMs, 2) a method for generating textual data from BIM and constructing corresponding BIM-derived datasets for LLM evaluation and fine-tuning, and 3) a fine-tuning strategy to adapt LLMs for BIM-based design. Results demonstrate that the proposed domain-specific benchmark effectively and comprehensively assesses LLM capabilities, highlighting that general LLMs are still incompetent for domain-specific tasks. Meanwhile, with the proposed benchmark and datasets, Qwen-BIM is developed and achieves a 21.0% average increase in G-Eval score compared to the base LLM model. Notably, with only 14B parameters, performance of Qwen-BIM is comparable to that of general LLMs with 671B parameters for BIM-based design tasks.

Because of their rich structure, these curated, but naturalistic datasets are key to answer some core questions about current large language models abilities: do LLMs detect linguistic objects and their properties? Do they detect and use systematic patterns across sentences? Are they more prone to linguistic or reasoning errors, and how do these interact?   We show that BLMs, while challenging, can be solved at good levels of performance, in more than one language, with simple baseline models or, at better performance levels, with more tailored models.

Although a growing set of metrics capture many of these considerations, they are rarely organized in a way that supports consistent evaluation, leaving no unified taxonomy for assessing and comparing LLM utility across use cases. To address this gap, we introduce the Language Model Utility Taxonomy (LUX), a comprehensive framework that structures utility evaluation across four domains: performance, interaction, operations, and governance. Within each domain, LUX is organized hierarchically into thematically aligned dimensions and components, each grounded in metrics that enable quantitative comparison and alignment of model selection with intended use.

First, a shape model learns a compact latent representation of left ventricular geometries. The learned latent space effectively encodes anatomies and enables synthetic geometries generation for data augmentation. Second, a neural field-based surrogate model, conditioned on this geometric encoding, is trained to predict ventricular displacement under external loading. The proposed architecture performs positional encoding by using universal ventricular coordinates, which improves generalization across diverse anatomies. Geometric variability is encoded using two alternative strategies, which are systematically compared: a PCA-based approach suitable for working with point cloud representations of geometries, and a DeepSDF-based implicit neural representation learned directly from point clouds.

This model completely separates between the predictive and algorithmic components, thus offering a single well-defined analysis framework that relies solely on the considered problem. Formulated through the lens of request-answer games, an OAG algorithm receives, with each incoming request, a piece of guidance which is taken from the problem's answer space; ideally, this guidance is the optimal answer for the current request, however with probability $β$, the guidance is adversarially corrupted. The goal is to develop OAG algorithms that admit good competitiveness when $β= 0$ (a.k.a. consistency) as well as when $β= 1$ (a.k.a. robustness); the appealing notion of smoothness, that in most prior work required a dedicated loss function, now arises naturally as $β$ shifts from $0$ to $1$.   We then describe a systematic method, called the drop or trust blindly (DTB) compiler, which transforms any online algorithm into a learning-augmented online algorithm in the OAG model. Given a prediction-oblivious online algorithm, its learning-augmented counterpart produced by applying the DTB compiler either follows the incoming guidance blindly or ignores it altogether and proceeds as the initial algorithm would have; the choice between these two alternatives is based on the outcome of a (biased) coin toss. As our main technical contribution, we prove (rigorously) that although remarkably simple, the class of algorithms produced via the DTB compiler includes algorithms with attractive consistency-robustness guarantees for three classic online problems: for caching and uniform metrical task systems our algorithms are optimal, whereas for bipartite matching (with adversarial arrival order), our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art.", "authors": "Julien Dallot, Yuval Emek, Yuval Gil et al.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.20706", "score": 0.294}, {"id": "2602.20480", "title": "VINA: Variational Invertible Neural Architectures", "abstract": "The distinctive architectural features of normalizing flows (NFs), notably bijectivity and tractable Jacobians, make them well-suited for generative modeling.

First, low-active users and new users have limited search behavioral data, making it difficult to achieve effective personalized relevance preference modeling. Second, training data for ranking models predominantly come from high-relevance exposures, creating a distribution mismatch with the broader candidate space in coarse-ranking, leading to generalization bias. Third, due to the latency constraint, the original model employs an Emb+MLP architecture with a frozen BERT encoder, which prevents joint optimization and creates misalignment between representation learning and CTR fine-tuning. To solve these issues, we further reinforce our method and propose PRECTR-V2. Specifically, we mitigate the low-activity users' sparse behavior problem by mining global relevance preferences under the specific query, which facilitates effective personalized relevance modeling for cold-start scenarios. Subsequently, we construct hard negative samples through embedding noise injection and relevance label reconstruction, and optimize their relative ranking against positive samples via pairwise loss, thereby correcting exposure bias.

Specifically, the latter provides a theoretical framework for teaching mappings that are implicitly defined (i.e., nonparametric) via example selection. Such an implicit mapping is embodied through a dense set of sequence-property pairs, with the AtteNT teacher selecting a subset to accelerate convergence in attention learner training. By analytically investigating the role of attention on parameter-based gradient descent during training, and recasting the evolution of attention learners, shaped by parameter updates, through functional gradient descent in nonparametric teaching, we show for the first time that teaching attention learners is consistent with teaching importance-adaptive nonparametric learners.

The law of robustness states that overparameterization is necessary for models to interpolate robustly; in particular, robust interpolation requires the learned function to be Lipschitz. Robust generalization asks whether small robust training loss implies small robust test loss. We resolve this problem by explicitly connecting the two for arbitrary data distributions. Specifically, we introduce a nontrivial notion of robust generalization error and convert it into a lower bound on the expected Rademacher complexity of the induced robust loss class. Our bounds recover the $Ω(n^{1/d})$ regime of Wu et al.

We conduct experiments to probe the predicted scaling with dataset size and model capacity, testing whether empirical behavior aligns more closely with the predictions of Bubeck and Sellke (2021) or Wu et al.

To bridge this gap and advance spatio-temporal foundation models for urban systems, we adopt scaling as the central perspective and systematically investigate two key questions: what to scale and how to scale. Grounded in first-principles analysis, we identify three critical dimensions: heterogeneity, correlation, and dynamics, aligning these principles with the fundamental scientific properties of urban spatio-temporal data.

At the high level, a VLM planner decomposes tasks into sub-goals and monitors robot execution in a closed loop, enabling the system to recover from single-step failures through autonomous re-planning. To compute low-level robot actions, we extract and utilize both task-relevant object keypoints and human hand poses as kinematic priors from the generated videos, and employ a switching mechanism to choose the better one as a reference for robot actions, maintaining stable execution even under heavy occlusion or depth inaccuracy.

Here we develop an analytical theory of the pretraining-fine-tuning pipeline in diagonal linear networks, deriving exact expressions for the generalization error as a function of initialization parameters and task statistics. We find that different initialization choices place the network into four distinct fine-tuning regimes that are distinguished by their ability to support feature learning and reuse, and therefore by the task statistics for which they are beneficial. In particular, a smaller initialization scale in earlier layers enables the network to both reuse and refine its features, leading to superior generalization on fine-tuning tasks that rely on a subset of pretraining features. We demonstrate empirically that the same initialization parameters impact generalization in nonlinear networks trained on CIFAR-100.

To test this hypothesis, we systematically evaluate probe generalization across five truth types (definitional, empirical, logical, fictional, and ethical), sycophantic and expectation-inverted lying, and existing honesty benchmarks. Linear probes generalize well across most domains but fail on sycophantic and expectation-inverted lying. Yet training on all domains jointly recovers strong performance, confirming that domain-general directions exist despite poor pairwise transfer. The geometry of probe directions explains these patterns: Mahalanobis cosine similarity between probes near-perfectly predicts cross-domain generalization (R^2=0.98). Concept-erasure methods further isolate truth directions that are (1) domain-general, (2) domain-specific, or (3) shared only across particular domain subsets. Causal interventions reveal that domain-specific directions steer more effectively than domain-general ones. Finally, post-training reshapes truth geometry, pushing sycophantic lying further from other truth types, suggesting a representational basis for chat models' sycophantic tendencies.

Currently, the available ASA tools follow Western music rules. The musical composition requires all notes to stay within their expected pitch range from start to finish. The system fails to detect micro-intervals and pitch bends, so it identifies Kurdish maqam singing as incorrect even though the singer performs according to traditional rules.

However, the main shortcoming of these calibration methods is that they do not balance the proportion of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. Not balancing these uncertainties can severely misrepresent predictive uncertainty, leading to overconfident predictions in some input regions while being underconfident in others. To address this shortcoming, we present a simple but powerful calibration algorithm Joint Uncertainty Calibration (JUCAL) that jointly calibrates aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. JUCAL jointly calibrates two constants to weight and scale epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties by optimizing the negative log-likelihood (NLL) on the validation/calibration dataset. JUCAL can be applied to any trained ensemble of classifiers (e.g., transformers, CNNs, or tree-based methods), with minimal computational overhead, without requiring access to the models' internal parameters. We experimentally evaluate JUCAL on various text classification tasks, for ensembles of varying sizes and with different ensembling strategies. Our experiments show that JUCAL significantly outperforms SOTA calibration methods across all considered classification tasks, reducing NLL and predictive set size by up to 15% and 20%, respectively. Interestingly, even applying JUCAL to an ensemble of size 5 can outperform temperature-scaled ensembles of size up to 50 in terms of NLL and predictive set size, resulting in up to 10 times smaller inference costs.

Within this space, the simplex constraint reduces to a linear orthogonality condition <v, 1> = 0, defining a codimension-one subspace H0. Minimizing distance to an unconstrained target u_star yields the work-dissipation functional J(v) = <g, v> - (mu / 2) ||v||^2, whose maximizer follows directly from the Hilbert projection theorem. Enforcing the boundary v >= -1 produces a bounded Hilbert projection that induces exact sparsity, assigning zero probability to catastrophically poor actions through a closed-form threshold. To connect this functional theory with practice, GOPO projects from infinite-dimensional L2(pi_k) to a finite empirical subspace induced by group sampling.

Although prior work shows that OOD detection performance varies by artefact type, the underlying causes remain underexplored. To this end, we identify a previously unreported bias in OOD detection: for hard-to-detect artefacts (near-OOD), detection performance typically improves when the artefact shares visual similarity (e.g. colour) with the model's ROI and drops when it does not - a phenomenon we term the Invisible Gorilla Effect. For example, in a skin lesion classifier with red lesion ROI, we show the method Mahalanobis Score achieves a 31.5% higher AUROC when detecting OOD red ink (similar to ROI) compared to black ink (dissimilar) annotations. We annotated artefacts by colour in 11,355 images from three public datasets (e.g. ISIC) and generated colour-swapped counterfactuals to rule out dataset bias. We then evaluated 40 OOD methods across 7 benchmarks and found significant performance drops for most methods when artefacts differed from the ROI.

We show that such aggregation can induce systematic bias of the group-level causal effect: even when models for predicting the individual-level conditional average treatment effect (CATE) are correctly specified and trained on data from randomized experiments, aggregating the predicted CATEs up to the group level does not, in general, recover the corresponding group average treatment effect (GATE).

We extend this principle to vision-language alignment, showing that isolating and aligning structural cues across modalities can greatly benefit fine-tuning on long, detail-rich captions, with a specific focus on improving cross-modal retrieval. We introduce StructXLIP, a fine-tuning alignment paradigm that extracts edge maps (e.g., Canny), treating them as proxies for the visual structure of an image, and filters the corresponding captions to emphasize structural cues, making them \"structure-centric\". Fine-tuning augments the standard alignment loss with three structure-centric losses: (i) aligning edge maps with structural text, (ii) matching local edge regions to textual chunks, and (iii) connecting edge maps to color images to prevent representation drift. From a theoretical standpoint, while standard CLIP maximizes the mutual information between visual and textual embeddings, StructXLIP additionally maximizes the mutual information between multimodal structural representations. This auxiliary optimization is intrinsically harder, guiding the model toward more robust and semantically stable minima, enhancing vision-language alignment.

However, practical composition and performance workflows frequently rely on resource-limited devices (e.g., electronic instruments and portable computers), making heavy memory and attention computation difficult to deploy. We introduce Depth-Structured Music Recurrence (DSMR), a recurrent long-context Transformer for full-piece symbolic music modeling that extends context beyond fixed-length excerpts via segment-level recurrence with detached cross-segment states, featuring a layer-wise memory-horizon schedule that budgets recurrent KV states across depth. DSMR is trained in a single left-to-right pass over each complete composition, akin to how a musician experiences it from beginning to end, while carrying recurrent cross-segment states forward. Within this recurrent framework, we systematically study how depth-wise horizon allocations affect optimization, best-checkpoint perplexity, and efficiency. By allocating different history-window lengths across layers while keeping the total recurrent-state budget fixed, DSMR creates depth-dependent temporal receptive fields within a recurrent attention stack without reducing compute depth. Our main instantiation is a two-scale DSMR schedule that allocates long history windows to lower layers and a uniform short window to the remaining layers.

To maximally reduce the computational costs, ADAMAB trains embedder-agnostic light-weight calibrators on top of fixed embedding models without accessing their parameters. To mitigate the need for large-scale training data, we introduce an adaptive data augmentation strategy based on the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) mechanism. With a modified upper confidence bound algorithm, ADAMAB diminishes the gradient shifting and offers theoretically guaranteed convergence in few-shot training.

To integrate information across levels, the Inter-Level Co-Aggregation Domain (InterCAD) synchronizes semantic scales using learned anchors, selectively fuses the shared representations, and gates private cues to form a compact task representation.

This is motivated from educational scenarios where learners describe a formal language (presented, e.g., by a finite state automaton, regular expression, pushdown automaton, context-free grammar or in set notation) in natural language, and an educational support system has to (1) judge whether the natural-language description accurately describes the formal language, and to (2) provide explanations why descriptions are not accurate.   To address this question, we introduce a representation language for formal languages, Nile, which is designed so that Nile expressions can mirror the syntactic structure of natural-language descriptions of formal languages. Nile is sufficiently expressive to cover a broad variety of formal languages, including all regular languages and fragments of context-free languages typically used in educational contexts.

Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) provide some alleviation of these limitations, but have problems of their own. The key step of specifying prior distributions in BNNs is no trivial task, yet is often skipped out of convenience. In this work, we propose a new class of prior distributions for BNNs, the Dirichlet scale mixture (DSM) prior, that addresses current limitations in Bayesian neural networks through structured, sparsity-inducing shrinkage. Theoretically, we derive general dependence structures and shrinkage results for DSM priors and show how they manifest under the geometry induced by neural networks. In experiments on simulated and real world data we find that the DSM priors encourages sparse networks through implicit feature selection, show robustness under adversarial attacks and deliver competitive predictive performance with substantially fewer effective parameters. In particular, their advantages appear most pronounced in correlated, moderately small data regimes, and are more amenable to weight pruning. Moreover, by adopting heavy-tailed shrinkage mechanisms, our approach aligns with recent findings that such priors can mitigate the cold posterior effect, offering a principled alternative to the commonly used Gaussian priors.", "authors": "August Arnstad, Leiv Rønneberg, Geir Storvik", "url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.19859", "score": 0.294}, {"id": "2602.20220", "title": "What Matters for Simulation to Online Reinforcement Learning on Real Robots", "abstract": "We investigate what specific design choices enable successful online reinforcement learning (RL) on physical robots.

In this work, an interpolation-assisted ML framework was developed using discrete dose datasets generated with the pyDOSEIA suite for 17 gamma-emitting radionuclides across varying downwind distances, release heights, and atmospheric stability categories. The datasets were augmented using shape-preserving interpolation to construct dense, high-resolution training data. Two tree-based ML models (Random Forest and XGBoost) and one deep learning (DL) model (TabNet) were evaluated to examine predictive performance and sensitivity to dataset resolution. All models showed higher prediction accuracy with the interpolated high-resolution dataset than with the discrete data; however, XGBoost consistently achieved the highest accuracy. Interpretability analysis using permutation importance (tree-based models) and attention-based feature attribution (TabNet) revealed that performance differences stem from how the models utilize input features.

We show that learning group operations is a special case of learning FDA, and that learning multiplication in FDA amounts to learning a bilinear product specified by the algebra's structure tensor. For algebras over the reals, we connect the learning problem to matrix factorization with an implicit low-rank bias, and for algebras over finite fields, we show that grokking emerges naturally as models must learn discrete representations of algebraic elements. This leads us to experimentally investigate the following core questions: (i) how do algebraic properties such as commutativity, associativity, and unitality influence both the emergence and timing of grokking, (ii) how structural properties of the structure tensor of the FDA, such as sparsity and rank, influence generalization, and (iii) to what extent generalization correlates with the model learning latent embeddings aligned with the algebra's representation.

However, in reality, data owners can have different motivations and act in unpredictable ways, making this assumption unrealistic. To demonstrate how a malicious client can compromise the semi-honest model, we first designed an inference manipulation attack against a range of state-of-the-art private inference protocols. This attack allows a malicious client to modify the model output with 3x to 8x fewer queries than current black-box attacks. Motivated by the attacks, we proposed and implemented RobPI, a robust and resilient private inference protocol that withstands malicious clients. RobPI integrates a distinctive cryptographic protocol that bolsters security by weaving encryption-compatible noise into the logits and features of private inference, thereby efficiently warding off malicious-client attacks.

Prevailing evaluation approaches, which measure only end-to-end task success, offer limited insight into how these failures arise or how effectively agents recover from them. To bridge this gap, we propose MAS-FIRE, a systematic framework for fault injection and reliability evaluation of MAS.

Applying MAS-FIRE to three representative MAS architectures, we uncover a rich set of fault-tolerant behaviors that we organize into four tiers: mechanism, rule, prompt, and reasoning. This tiered view enables fine-grained diagnosis of where and why systems succeed or fail. Our findings reveal that stronger foundation models do not uniformly improve robustness.

Existing models address this by learning maps between distributions, but typically assume a single fixed response distribution when conditioned on observed cellular context (e.g., cell type) and the perturbation type. In reality, responses vary systematically due to unobservable latent factors such as microenvironmental fluctuations and complex batch effects, forming a manifold of possible distributions for the same observed conditions.

We prove that constant-depth networks equipped with smooth activations automatically exploit arbitrarily high orders of target function smoothness, achieving the minimax-optimal approximation and estimation error rates (up to logarithmic factors).

These results identify activation smoothness as a fundamental mechanism, alternative to depth, for attaining statistical optimality.

Our approach statically extracts structural and semantic features from Pickle bytecode and applies supervised and unsupervised models to classify files as benign or malicious. We construct and release a labeled dataset of 727 Pickle-based files from Hugging Face and evaluate our models on four datasets: our own, PickleBall (out-of-distribution), Hide-and-Seek (9 advanced evasive malicious models), and synthetic joblib files. Our method achieves 90.01% F1-score compared with 7.23%-62.75% achieved by the SOTA scanners (Modelscan, Fickling, ClamAV, VirusTotal) on our dataset. Furthermore, on the PickleBall data (OOD), it achieves 81.22% F1-score compared with 76.09% achieved by the PickleBall method, while remaining fully library-agnostic. Finally, we show that our method is the only one to correctly parse and classify 9/9 evasive Hide-and-Seek malicious models specially crafted to evade scanners.

To study this threat at scale without ethical concerns, we simulate these physical attacks on 329 facial images of individuals aged 10 to 21 using a VLM image editor (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image).

We introduce the Attack Conversion Rate (ACR), defined as the fraction of images predicted as minor at baseline that flip to adult after attack, a population-agnostic metric that does not depend on the ratio of minors to adults in the test set. Our results reveal that a synthetic beard alone achieves 28 to 69 percent ACR across all eight models; combining all four attacks shifts predicted age by +7.7 years on average across all 329 subjects and reaches up to 83 percent ACR; and vision-language models exhibit lower ACR (59 to 71 percent) than specialized models (63 to 83 percent) under the full attack, although the ACR ranges overlap and the difference is not statistically tested.

Second, the reconstruction process is primarily driven by local geometric proximity, neglecting the human and object appearances that provide global context crucial for understanding holistic interactions. To address these issues, we introduce TeHOR, a framework built upon two core designs. First, beyond contact information, our framework leverages text descriptions of human-object interactions to enforce semantic alignment between the 3D reconstruction and its textual cues, enabling reasoning over a wider spectrum of interactions, including non-contact cases.

This necessitates an exploration strategy that maintains productive stochasticity while avoiding the drawbacks of uncontrolled random sampling, yielding inefficient exploration. In this paper, we propose CalibRL, a hybrid-policy RLVR framework that supports controllable exploration with expert guidance, enabled by two key mechanisms. First, a distribution-aware advantage weighting scales updates by group rareness to calibrate the distribution, therefore preserving exploration. Meanwhile, the asymmetric activation function (LeakyReLU) leverages the expert knowledge as a calibration baseline to moderate overconfident updates while preserving their corrective direction. CalibRL increases policy entropy in a guided manner and clarifies the target distribution by estimating the on-policy distribution through online sampling. Updates are driven by these informative behaviors, avoiding convergence to erroneous patterns. Importantly, these designs help alleviate the distributional mismatch between the model's policy and expert trajectories, thereby achieving a more stable balance between exploration and exploitation.

At the neuron level, we uncover a surprisingly large overlap: more than half of the top-activated units during multi-step inference are shared between representative LLMs and LVLMs, revealing a modality-invariant inference subspace.   Through causal probing via activation amplification, we further show that these shared neurons encode consistent and interpretable concept-level effects, demonstrating their functional contribution to inference. Building on this insight, we propose Shared Neuron Low-Rank Fusion (SNRF), a parameter-efficient framework that transfers mature inference circuitry from LLMs to LVLMs. SNRF profiles cross-model activations to identify shared neurons, computes a low-rank approximation of inter-model weight differences, and injects these updates selectively within the shared-neuron subspace. This mechanism strengthens multimodal inference performance with minimal parameter changes and requires no large-scale multimodal fine-tuning.

Every well-defined tool-use task imposes a canonical solution path (i.e., a convergent set of tool invocations shared across successful runs) and agent success depends critically on whether a trajectory stays within this path's operating envelope. We establish this causally using a natural experiment that holds model capability and task difficulty fixed by construction. We analyze trajectories from the Toolathlon benchmark: 22 frontier models each attempt 108 real-world tool-use tasks across 3 independent runs, yielding 515 model$\\times$task units where the same model succeeds on some runs and fails on others due to LLM sampling stochasticity alone.

We define an \\emph{entropy potential} $Φ(\\mathcal{H})=\\int_{0}^{diam(\\mathcal{H})} \\log N(\\mathcal{H},\\varepsilon)\\,d\\varepsilon$, where $N(\\mathcal{H},\\varepsilon)$ is the $\\varepsilon$-covering number of $\\mathcal{H}$, and show that for every $c$-approximate pseudo-metric loss, $\\mathbb{D}_{\\mathrm{onl}}(\\mathcal{H})\\le O(c)\\,Φ(\\mathcal{H})$. In particular, polynomial metric entropy implies $Φ(\\mathcal{H})<\\infty$ and hence a horizon-free realizable cumulative-loss bound with transparent dependence on effective dimension.   We illustrate the method on two families. We prove a sharp $q$-vs.-$d$ dichotomy for realizable online learning (finite and efficiently achievable $Θ_{d,q}(L^d)$ total loss for $L$-Lipschitz regression iff $q>d$, otherwise infinite), and for bounded-norm $k$-ReLU networks separate regression (finite loss, even $\\widetilde O(k^2)$, and $O(1)$ for one ReLU) from classification (impossible already for $k=2,d=1$).", "authors": "Ilan Doron-Arad, Idan Mehalel, Elchanan Mossel", "url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.19172", "score": 0.246}, {"id": "2602.19043", "title": "Uncovering Context Reliance in Unstructured Knowledge Editing", "abstract": "Editing Large language models (LLMs) with real-world, unstructured knowledge is essential for correcting and updating their internal parametric knowledge.

This hypothesis is supported by our empirical validation that prepending context during inference recovers knowledge recall. We further theoretically demonstrate that Context Reliance is an inherent consequence of gradient-based optimization, which tends to bind acquired knowledge to a specific aggregated contextual representation.

Using the data-driven method of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) on motion capture recordings of hawks, we show that multiple behavioral states such as flapping, turning, landing, and gliding, can be modeled by simple and interpretable modal structures (i.e. the underlying wing-tail shape) which can be linearly combined to reproduce the experimental flight observations. Moreover, the DMD model can be used to extrapolate naturalistic flapping.

In low-resource languages such as Bengali, automated detection remains challenging due to limited annotated data, class imbalance, and pervasive code-mixing. To address these issues, we augment the Bengali Hateful Memes (BHM) dataset with semantically aligned samples from the Multimodal Aggression Dataset in Bengali (MIMOSA), improving both class balance and semantic diversity. We propose the Enhanced Dual Co-attention Framework (xDORA), integrating vision encoders (CLIP, DINOv2) and multilingual text encoders (XGLM, XLM-R) via weighted attention pooling to learn robust cross-modal representations. Building on these embeddings, we develop a FAISS-based k-nearest neighbor classifier for non-parametric inference and introduce RAG-Fused DORA, which incorporates retrieval-driven contextual reasoning. We further evaluate LLaVA under zero-shot, few-shot, and retrieval-augmented prompting settings. Experiments on the extended dataset show that xDORA (CLIP + XLM-R) achieves macro-average F1-scores of 0.78 for hateful meme identification and 0.71 for target entity detection, while RAG-Fused DORA improves performance to 0.79 and 0.74, yielding gains over the DORA baseline. The FAISS-based classifier performs competitively and demonstrates robustness for rare classes through semantic similarity modeling.

We evaluate current State-of-the-Art (SOTA) LLMs on VIRAASAT and identify key limitations in reasoning wherein fine-tuning on Chain-of-Thought(CoT) traces fails to ground and synthesize low-probability facts. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework named Symbolic Chain-of-Manipulation (SCoM). Adapting the Chain-of-Manipulation paradigm, we train the model to simulate atomic Knowledge Graph manipulations internally. SCoM teaches the model to reliably traverse the topological structure of the graph. Experiments on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) demonstrate that SCoM outperforms standard CoT baselines by up to 20%.

Most prior work on learning from corrections involves interpreting a correction as a new demonstration (consisting of the modified robot behavior), or a preference (for the modified trajectory compared to the robot's original behavior). However, this overlooks one essential element of the correction feedback, which is the human's decision to intervene in the robot's behavior in the first place. This decision can be influenced by multiple factors including the robot's task progress, alignment with human expectations, dynamics, motion legibility, and optimality. In this work, we investigate whether the timing of this decision can offer a useful signal for inferring these task-relevant influences. In particular, we investigate three potential applications for this learning signal: (1) identifying features of a robot's motion that may prompt people to correct it, (2) quickly inferring the final goal of a human's correction based on the timing and initial direction of their correction motion, and (3) learning more precise constraints for task objectives.

However, if artificial systems are to move toward true autonomy-operating over long horizons and across evolving contexts-objectives may become ill-defined, shifting, or entirely absent. In such settings, a fundamental question emerges: in the absence of an explicit objective function, how can a system determine whether its ongoing internal dynamics are productive or pathological? And how should it regulate structural change without external supervision? In this work, we propose a dynamical framework for learning without an explicit objective. Instead of minimizing external error signals, the system evaluates the intrinsic health of its own internal dynamics and regulates structural plasticity accordingly. We introduce a two-timescale architecture that separates fast state evolution from slow structural adaptation, coupled through an internally generated stress variable that accumulates evidence of persistent dynamical dysfunction. Structural modification is then triggered not continuously, but as a state-dependent event. Through a minimal toy model, we demonstrate that this stress-regulated mechanism produces temporally segmented, self-organized learning episodes without reliance on externally defined goals.

Generating DP synthetic data typically involves a difficult trade-off. On one hand, DP finetuning methods train an LLM as a synthetic data generator with formal privacy guarantees, yet it still requires the raw content of private examples for model training. However, methods that avoid direct exposure to private data are bounded by an off-the-shelf, un-finetuned model, whose outputs often lack domain fidelity. Can we train an LLM to generate high-quality synthetic text without eyes-on access to individual private examples? In this work, we introduce Differentially Private Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (DP-RFT), an online reinforcement learning algorithm for synthetic data generation with LLMs. DP-RFT leverages DP-protected nearest-neighbor votes from an eyes-off private corpus as a reward signal for on-policy synthetic samples generated by an LLM. The LLM iteratively learns to generate synthetic data to maximize the expected DP votes through Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). We evaluate DP-RFT for long-form and domain-specific synthetic data generation, such as news articles, meeting transcripts, and medical article abstracts.

A key challenge in RL is measuring task complexity, which is essential for creating meaningful benchmarks and designing effective curricula. While there are numerous well-established metrics for assessing task complexity in tabular settings, relatively few exist in non-tabular domains. These include (i) Statistical analysis of the performance of random policies via Random Weight Guessing (RWG), and (ii) information-theoretic metrics Policy Information Capacity (PIC) and Policy-Optimal Information Capacity (POIC), which are reliant on RWG. In this paper, we evaluate these methods using progressively difficult robotic manipulation setups, with known relative complexity, with both dense and sparse reward formulations. Our empirical results reveal that measuring complexity is still nuanced. Specifically, under the same reward formulation, PIC suggests that a two-link robotic arm setup is easier than a single-link setup - which contradicts the robotic control and empirical RL perspective whereby the two-link setup is inherently more complex. Likewise, for the same setup, POIC estimates that tasks with sparse rewards are easier than those with dense rewards. Thus, we show that both PIC and POIC contradict typical understanding and empirical results from RL.

This paper focuses on such student questions from two datasets of distinct learning contexts: formative self-study, and summative assessed coursework. We analysed 6,113 messages from both learning contexts, using 11 different LLMs and three human raters to classify student questions using four existing schemas. On the feasibility of using LLMs as raters, results showed moderate-to-good inter-rater reliability, with higher consistency than human raters. The data showed that 'procedural' questions predominated in both learning contexts, but more so when students prepare for summative assessment. These results provide a basis on which to use LLMs for classification of student questions.

Traditional centralized optimization and off-policy reinforcement learning struggle with scalability and signaling overhead in dense networks. This paper proposes CADDTO-PPO, a carbon-aware decentralized dynamic task offloading framework based on multi-agent proximal policy optimization. The multi-user MIMO-MEC system is modeled as a Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (DEC-POMDP) to jointly minimize carbon emissions and buffer latency and energy wastage. A scalable architecture utilizes decentralized execution with parameter sharing (DEPS), which enables autonomous IoT agents to make fine-grained power control and offloading decisions based solely on local observations. Additionally, a carbon-first reward structure adaptively prioritizes green time slots for data transmission to decouple system throughput from grid-dependent carbon footprints. Finally, experimental results demonstrate CADDTO-PPO outperforms deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and lyapunov-based baselines.

While recent work suggests that high-dimensional concentration allows these models to implicitly estimate noise levels from corrupted observations, a fundamental paradox remains: what is the underlying landscape being optimized when the noise level is treated as a random variable, and how can a bounded, noise-agnostic network remain stable near the data manifold where gradients typically diverge? We resolve this paradox by formalizing Marginal Energy, $E_{\\text{marg}}(\\mathbf{u}) = -\\log p(\\mathbf{u})$, where $p(\\mathbf{u}) = \\int p(\\mathbf{u}|t)p(t)dt$ is the marginal density of the noisy data integrated over a prior distribution of unknown noise levels. We prove that generation using autonomous models is not merely blind denoising, but a specific form of Riemannian gradient flow on this Marginal Energy. Through a novel relative energy decomposition, we demonstrate that while the raw Marginal Energy landscape possesses a $1/t^p$ singularity normal to the data manifold, the learned time-invariant field implicitly incorporates a local conformal metric that perfectly counteracts the geometric singularity, converting an infinitely deep potential well into a stable attractor. We also establish the structural stability conditions for sampling with autonomous models. We identify a ``Jensen Gap'' in noise-prediction parameterizations that acts as a high-gain amplifier for estimation errors, explaining the catastrophic failure observed in deterministic blind models.

However, in the short train long test setting, autoregressive rollouts can become unstable. This typically happens for two reasons: one step errors accumulate over time, and high frequency components feed back and grow.   We introduce the Spectral Generator Neural Operator (SGNO), a residual time stepper that targets both effects. For the linear part, SGNO uses an exponential time differencing update in Fourier space with a learned diagonal generator. We constrain the real part of this generator to be nonpositive, so iterating the step does not amplify the linear dynamics. For nonlinear dynamics, SGNO adds a gated forcing term with channel mixing within each Fourier mode, which keeps the nonlinear update controlled. To further limit high frequency feedback, SGNO applies spectral truncation and an optional smooth mask on the forcing pathway.   We derive a one step amplification bound and a finite horizon rollout error bound. The bound separates generator approximation error from nonlinear mismatch and gives sufficient conditions under which the latent $L^2$ norm does not grow across rollout steps. On APEBench spanning 1D, 2D, and 3D PDE families, SGNO achieves lower long horizon error and longer stable rollout lengths than strong neural operator baselines.

Existing approaches to measuring memorization often conflate these phenomena, labeling outputs as memorized even when they arise from generalization over common patterns. Counterfactual Memorization provides a principled solution by comparing models trained with and without a target sequence, but its reliance on retraining multiple baseline models makes it computationally expensive and impractical at scale.   This work introduces Prior-Aware Memorization, a theoretically grounded, lightweight and training-free criterion for identifying genuine memorization in LLMs. The key idea is to evaluate whether a candidate suffix is strongly associated with its specific training prefix or whether it appears with high probability across many unrelated prompts due to statistical commonality.

Debugging and investigation of runtime behavior remains largely a manual, developer-driven process. Popular coding agents typically rely on either static analysis of the code or iterative test-fix cycles, which is akin to trial and error debugging. We posit that there is a wealth of rich runtime information that developers routinely access while debugging code, which agents are currently deprived of due to design limitations. Despite how prevalent debuggers are in modern IDEs and command-line tools, they have surprisingly not made their way into coding agents. In this work, we introduce Debug2Fix, a novel framework that incorporates interactive debugging as a core component of a software engineering agent via a subagent architecture. We incorporate debuggers for Java and Python into our agent framework and evaluate against GitBug-Java and SWE-Bench-Live and achieve >20% improvement in performance compared to the baseline for certain models. Furthermore, using our framework, we're able to make weaker models like GPT-5 and Claude Haiku 4.5 match or exceed the performances of stronger models like Claude Sonnet 4.5, showing that better tool design is often just as important as switching to a more expensive model. Finally, we conduct systematic ablations demonstrating the importance of both the subagent architecture and debugger integration.", "authors": "Spandan Garg, Yufan Huang", "url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.18571", "score": 0.141}, {"id": "2602.18793", "title": "From Few-Shot to Zero-Shot: Towards Generalist Graph Anomaly Detection", "abstract": "Graph anomaly detection (GAD) is critical for identifying abnormal nodes in graph-structured data from diverse domains, including cybersecurity and social networks. The existing GAD methods often focus on the learning paradigms of \"one-model-for-one-dataset\", requiring dataset-specific training for each dataset to achieve optimal performance. However, this paradigm suffers from significant limitations, such as high computational and data costs, limited generalization and transferability to new datasets, and challenges in privacy-sensitive scenarios where access to full datasets or sufficient labels is restricted. To address these limitations, we propose a novel generalist GAD paradigm that aims to develop a unified model capable of detecting anomalies on multiple unseen datasets without extensive retraining/fine-tuning or dataset-specific customization. To this end, we propose ARC, a few-shot generalist GAD method that leverages in-context learning and requires only a few labeled normal samples at inference time. Specifically, ARC consists of three core modules: a feature Alignment module to unify and align features across datasets, a Residual GNN encoder to capture dataset-agnostic anomaly representations, and a cross-attentive in-Context learning module to score anomalies using few-shot normal context. Building on ARC, we further introduce ARC_zero for the zero-shot generalist GAD setting, which selects representative pseudo-normal nodes via a pseudo-context mechanism and thus enables fully label-free inference on unseen datasets. Extensive experiments on 17 real-world graph datasets demonstrate that both ARC and ARC_zero effectively detect anomalies, exhibit strong generalization ability, and perform efficiently under few-shot and zero-shot settings.", "authors": "Yixin Liu, Shiyuan Li, Yu Zheng et al.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.18793", "score": 0.137}, {"id": "2602.18319", "title": "Robo-Saber: Generating and Simulating Virtual Reality Players", "abstract": "We present the first motion generation system for playtesting virtual reality (VR) games.

We study whether sub-city price indices can be forecasted at weekly frequency by combining physical development signals from satellite radar with market narratives from news text. Using over 350,000 transactions from Dubai Land Department (2015-2025), we construct weekly price indices for 19 sub-city regions and evaluate forecasts from 2 to 34 weeks ahead. Our framework fuses regional transaction history with Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter, news sentiment combining lexical tone and semantic embeddings, and macroeconomic context. Results are strongly horizon dependent: at horizons up to 10 weeks, price history alone matches multimodal configurations, but beyond 14 weeks sentiment and SAR become critical. At long horizons (26-34 weeks), the full multimodal model reduces mean absolute error from 4.48 to 2.93 (35% reduction), with gains statistically significant across regions. Nonparametric learners consistently outperform deep architectures in this data regime.

Here, we introduce the first large-scale lexicon capturing descriptive norms of anxiety associations for more than 20k English MWEs. We show that the anxiety associations are highly reliable. We use the lexicon to study prevalence of different types of anxiety- and calmness-associated MWEs; and how that varies across two-, three-, and four-word sequences. We also study the extent to which the anxiety association of MWEs is compositional (due to its constituent words).

We present MiSCHiEF, a set of two benchmarking datasets based on a contrastive pair design in the domains of safety (MiS) and culture (MiC), and evaluate four VLMs on tasks requiring fine-grained differentiation of paired images and captions. In both datasets, each sample contains two minimally differing captions and corresponding minimally differing images. In MiS, the image-caption pairs depict a safe and an unsafe scenario, while in MiC, they depict cultural proxies in two distinct cultural contexts. We find that models generally perform better at confirming the correct image-caption pair than rejecting incorrect ones. Additionally, models achieve higher accuracy when selecting the correct caption from two highly similar captions for a given image, compared to the converse task.
